Caribbean
A lot of us are happily trading the Great White North for the great white sand of places like Varadero, Punta Cana, Mexico.s Mayan Riviera, Hawaii and Florida. Some of us are taking off to cruise the Caribbean and visit ports of call in sunny places like the Cayman Islands, Jamaica and Barbados.
Others are tasting the Latin flavours of destinations like Costa Rica, Honduras and Margarita Island, Venezuela, or the history of Cartagena, the fortress town that once guarded treasure-laden Spanish galleons against the likes of Sir Francis Drake and Henry Morgan. Mind you, modern-day treasure hunters are more likely heading for the bright lights and sensational entertainment of Las Vegas and its casinos.

Mexico
A mix of the modern and traditional, with a landscape that is just as varied; Mexico is truly a traveller's paradise.
Whether it's the pristine beaches of the Riviera Maya that you're looking for, the unique, desert-like appearance of Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta's colonial charm, or Cancun's vibrant nightlife; each part of Mexico offers something a little different and something perfect for you.

Las Vegas
We want to help you find the perfect Las Vegas vacation packages, by bringing you great vacation deals, a huge selection of cheap vacations at popular destinations and outstanding customer service when booking your holiday.

Winnipeg
Why the freak would anyone want to go to Winnipeg? Why the heck not...that's what we say. Great deals to be had as no one in their right mind would even thing of such a thing, so hotels will give great deals to anyone stupid enough to do it. All you have to do is decide on the right season for your trip: Winterpeg season, mosquito season, or flood season. Whatever the time, if you're crazy enough to do it, they'll sure as heck take your money.
