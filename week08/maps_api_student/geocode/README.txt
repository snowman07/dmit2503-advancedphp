geocode.html should work with any address or postal code. Should be fine off the desktop.
Requires API key.

geolocate_ipinfo.php: A PHP script for a relatively new geolocate service. Will only work online, and may need some more research. May not work at NAIT (proxy servers), so please test it at home.
